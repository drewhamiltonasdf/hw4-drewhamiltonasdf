    "In this problem you'll use a direct method to optimize a walking trajectory for a simple biped model, using the hybrid dynamics formulation. You'll pre-specify a gait sequence and solve the problem using Ipopt, a high-quality open-source interior point nonlinear programming solver (actually developed here at CMU!). Your final solution should look like the video above.\n",

The system has three control inputs: a force along each leg, and the torque between the legs.\n",
